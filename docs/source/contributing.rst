Contributing
============

Thanks for being here!

There are many ways in which you can contribute to the development of Cascade.

Testing
-------
Run Cascade on your system. See if you can find those pesky bugs. Create an issue on Github if you got one.

Features
--------
There is a feature you would really like to see? Or there is an existing feature that you think could be improved? Let us know about it!

UI/UX and design
-----
Give feedback on the UI and how it could be improved. If you are a designer, maybe you want to help create a website? Or maybe you have a Youtube channel and want to make a tutorial video?

Documentation
-------------
Is there something that you would like to see in the documentation? From a developer's point of view it is sometimes very hard to tell what's obvious and what's not. Getting an outside view is very much appreciated.

GLSL
----

If you know how to write `GLSL` you could add new effects to Cascade by writing a shader. Or you could improve an existing one, check out the `shaders` folder.

C++
---

Look through the open issues and see if you can find something that interests you. If you need further information or clarification, don't hesitate to ask on Github or Discord.
