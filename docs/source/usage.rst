Usage
=====

Cascade is available as a portable build in the form of Windows binaries or a Linux appimage.

You can find the latest version on the `releases page <https://github.com/ttddee/Cascade/releases>`_ of the Github repository.

Requirements
------------

In order to run the application you will need a graphics card and driver that is able to run Vulkan.

Vulkan is widely supported nowadays. If you are in doubt, you can check if your GPU is supported `here <https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/>`_.

Windows
-------

Simply download the zip file from the releases page, extract it, and run `Cascade.exe`.

Linux
-----

Download the AppImage from the releases page and make it executable.

.. code-block:: console

   chmod a+x Cascade-Image-Editor-x86_64-xxx-release-xxx.AppImage

Then you can run the AppImage like so.

.. code-block:: console

   ./Cascade-Image-Editor-x86_64-xxx-release-xxx.AppImage

.. note:: 

   Cascade creates some files for logging and persistence when you first start it. In order to keep things neat, it is best to put the AppImage into its own folder.
